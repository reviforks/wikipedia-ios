[[File:Ward Cunningham, Inventor of the Wiki.webm|thumb|right|Interview with [[Ward Cunningham]], inventor of the wiki]]
A '''wiki''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-wiki.ogg|ˈ|w|ɪ|k|i}} {{respell|WIK|ee}}) is a [[website]] on which users [[collaborative software|collaboratively]] modify content and structure directly from the [[web browser]]. In a typical wiki, text is written using a simplified [[markup language]] and often edited with the help of a [[Online rich-text editor|rich-text editor]].<ref name="Britannica">{{citation|title=wiki|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|volume=1|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]]|year=2007|location=London|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1192819/wiki|accessdate=April 10, 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424074513/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1192819/wiki|archivedate=April 24, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

A wiki is run using [[wiki software]], otherwise known as a wiki engine. A wiki engine is a type of [[content management system]], but it differs from most other such systems, including [[blog software]], in that the content is created without any defined owner or leader, and wikis have little inherent structure, allowing structure to emerge according to the needs of the users.<ref name="Easy Wiki Hosting "/> There are dozens of different wiki engines in use, both standalone and part of other software, such as [[bug tracking system]]s. Some wiki engines are [[open-source software|open source]], whereas others are [[proprietary software|proprietary]]. Some permit control over different functions (levels of access); for example, editing rights may permit changing, adding, or removing material. Others may permit access without enforcing access control. Other rules may be imposed to organize content.

The online encyclopedia project [[Wikipedia]] is the most popular wiki-based website, and is one of the most widely viewed sites in the world, having been ranked in the top ten since 2007.<ref name="Alexa Top Sites">{{citation|url=http://www.alexa.com/topsites|title=Alexa Top Sites|accessdate=December 1, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302173920/http://www.alexa.com/topsites|archivedate=March 2, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Wikipedia is not a single wiki but rather a collection of hundreds of wikis, with each one pertaining to a specific language. In addition to Wikipedia, there are tens of thousands of other wikis in use, both public and private, including wikis functioning as [[knowledge management]] resources, [[notetaking software|notetaking]] tools, [[Web community|community websites]], and [[intranet]]s. The English-language Wikipedia has the largest collection of articles; as of September 2016, it had over five million articles. [[Ward Cunningham]], the developer of the first wiki software, [[WikiWikiWeb]], originally described it as "the simplest online database that could possibly work".<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.wiki.org/wiki.cgi?WhatIsWiki|title=What is a Wiki|accessdate=April 10, 2008|publisher=WikiWikiWeb|last=Cunningham|first=Ward|date=June 27, 2002|authorlink=Ward Cunningham|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416212802/http://www.wiki.org/wiki.cgi?WhatIsWiki|archivedate=April 16, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref> "[[wikt:wiki#Hawaiian|Wiki]]" (pronounced {{IPA-haw|ˈwiki|}}{{refn|group=note|The realization of the Hawaiian {{IPA|/w/|lang=haw}} [[phoneme]] varies between {{IPA|[w]|lang=haw}} and {{IPA|[v]|lang=haw}}, and the realization of the {{IPA|/k/|lang=haw}} phoneme varies between {{IPA|[k]|lang=haw}} and {{IPA|[t]|lang=haw}}, among other realizations.

==Characteristics==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2017}}
[[File:Ward Cunningham - Commons-1.jpg|thumb|[[Ward Cunningham]], inventor of the wiki]]
Ward Cunningham and co-author [[Bo Leuf]], in their book ''[[The Wiki Way|The Wiki Way: Quick Collaboration on the Web]]'', described the essence of the Wiki concept as follows:<ref>{{harvnb|Leuf| Cunningham|2001 }}. See Ward Cunningham's site {{cite web |url=http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiDesignPrinciples |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2002-04-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020430181259/http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiDesignPrinciples |archivedate=April 30, 2002 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><!-- page number requested -->
* A wiki invites all users—not just experts—to edit any [[Web page|page]] or to create new pages within the wiki Web site, using only a standard [[vanilla software|"plain-vanilla"]] Web browser without any extra [[browser extension|add-ons]].
* Wiki promotes meaningful topic associations between different pages by making page link creation intuitively easy and showing whether an intended target page exists or not.
* A wiki is ''not'' a carefully crafted site created by experts and professional writers, and designed for casual visitors. Instead, it seeks to involve the typical visitor/user in an ongoing process of creation and collaboration that constantly changes the website landscape.

A wiki enables communities of editors and contributors to write documents collaboratively. All that people require to contribute is a computer, [[Internet]] access, a [[web browser]], and a basic understanding of a simple [[markup language]] (e.g., [[HTML]]). A single page in a wiki website is referred to as a "wiki page", while the entire collection of pages, which are usually well-interconnected by [[hyperlink]]s, is "the wiki". A wiki is essentially a database for creating, browsing, and searching through information. A wiki allows non-linear, evolving, complex, and networked text, while also allowing for editor argument, debate, and interaction regarding the content and formatting.<ref name=Legal>{{citation|title=Legal Issues for Wikis: The Challenge of User-generated and Peer-produced Knowledge, Content and Culture|last1=Black|first1=Peter|last2=Delaney|first2=Hayden|last3=Fitzgerald|first3=Brian|volume=14|publisher=eLaw J.|year=2007|url=https://elaw.murdoch.edu.au/archives/issues/2007/1/eLaw_legal%20issues%20for%20wikis.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121222125337/https://elaw.murdoch.edu.au/archives/issues/2007/1/eLaw_legal%20issues%20for%20wikis.pdf|archivedate=December 22, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> A defining characteristic of wiki technology is the ease with which pages can be created and updated. Generally, there is no review by a moderator or gatekeeper before modifications are accepted and thus lead to changes on the website. Many wikis are open to alteration by the general public without requiring registration of [[User (computing)|user]] accounts. Many edits can be made in [[Real-time web|real-time]] and appear almost instantly online. However, this feature facilitates abuse of the system. Private wiki servers require [[Authentication|user authentication]] to edit pages, and sometimes even to read them. [[Maged N. Kamel Boulos]], Cito Maramba, and [[Steve Wheeler]] write that the open wikis produce a process of [[Social Darwinism]]. {{"'}}Unfit' sentences and sections are ruthlessly culled, edited, and replaced if they are not considered 'fit', which hopefully results in the evolution of a higher quality and more relevant page. While such [[openness]] may invite 'vandalism' and the posting of untrue information, this same openness also makes it possible to rapidly correct or restore a 'quality' wiki page."<ref name=BMC/>

===Editing===
{{for|the project page on editing Wikitext on Wikipedia|Help:Wikitext}}
{{Wikitext navbox}}
Some wikis have an Edit button or link directly on the page being viewed, if the user has permission to edit the page. This can lead to a text-based editing page where participants can structure and format wiki pages with a simplified markup language, sometimes known as '''Wikitext''', '''Wiki markup''' or '''Wikicode''' (it can also lead to a [[WYSIWYG]] editing page; see the paragraph after the table below). For example, starting lines of text with [[asterisk]]s could create a [[Bullet (typography)|bulleted list]]. The style and syntax of wikitexts can vary greatly among wiki implementations,{{example needed|date=August 2018}} some of which also allow [[HTML]] tags.

Wikis have favoured plain-text editing, with fewer and simpler conventions than HTML, for indicating style and structure. Although limiting access to HTML and [[Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS) of wikis limits user ability to alter the structure and formatting of wiki content, there are some benefits. Limited access to CSS promotes consistency in the look and feel, and having [[JavaScript]] disabled prevents a user from implementing code that may limit other users' access.

<p>"I've had <b>nothing</b> yet," Alice replied in an offended tone, "so I can't take more."</p>

|"Take some more [[tea]]," the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.

"I've had '''nothing''' yet," Alice replied in an offended tone, "so I can't take more."

"You mean you can't take ''less''?" said the Hatter. "It's very easy to take ''more'' than nothing."
|}

Wikis can also make [[WYSIWYG]] editing available to users, usually by means of JavaScript control that translates graphically entered formatting instructions into the corresponding [[HTML element|HTML tags]] or wikitext. In those implementations, the markup of a newly edited, marked-up version of the page is generated and submitted to the server [[transparency (human-computer interaction)|transparently]], shielding the user from this technical detail. An example of this is the [[VisualEditor]] on Wikipedia. However, WYSIWYG controls do not always provide all of the features available in wikitext, and some users prefer not to use a WYSIWYG editor. Hence, many of these sites offer some means to edit the wikitext directly.

Some wikis keep a record of changes made to wiki pages; often, every version of the page is stored. This means that authors can revert to an older version of the page should it be necessary because a mistake has been made, such as the content accidentally being deleted or the page has been vandalized to include offensive or malicious text or other inappropriate content.

Many wiki implementations, such as [[MediaWiki]], allow users to supply an ''edit summary'' when they edit a page. This is a short piece of text summarizing the changes they have made (e.g., "Corrected grammar," or "Fixed formatting in table."). It is not inserted into the article's main text, but is stored along with that revision of the page, allowing users to explain what has been done and why, similar to a log message when making changes in a [[revision control|revision-control]] system. This enables other users to see which changes have been made by whom and why, often in a list of summaries, dates and other short, relevant content, a list which is called a "log" or "history."

===Navigation===
Within the text of most pages, there are usually a large number of [[hypertext]] links to other pages within the wiki. This form of non-linear navigation is more "native" to a wiki than structured/formalized navigation schemes. Users can also create any number of index or table-of-contents pages, with hierarchical categorization or whatever form of organization they like. These may be challenging to maintain "by hand", as multiple authors and users may create and delete pages in an [[ad hoc]], unorganized manner. Wikis can provide one or more ways to categorize or tag pages to support the maintenance of such index pages. Some wikis, including the original, have a [[backlink]] feature, which displays all pages that link to a given page. It is also typically possible in a wiki to create links to pages that do not yet exist, as a way to invite others to share what they know about a subject new to the wiki. Wiki users can typically "tag" pages with categories or keywords, to make it easier for other users to find the article. For example, a user creating a new article on [[cold weather cycling]] might "tag" this page under the categories of commuting, winter sports and bicycling. This would make it easier for other users to find the article.

===Linking and creating pages===
Links are created using a specific syntax, the so-called "link pattern". Originally, most wikis{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} used [[CamelCase]] to name pages and create links. These are produced by capitalizing words in a phrase and removing the spaces between them (the word "CamelCase" is itself an example). While CamelCase makes linking easy, it also leads to links in a form that deviates from the standard spelling. To link to a page with a single-word title, one must abnormally capitalize one of the letters in the word (e.g. "WiKi" instead of "Wiki"). CamelCase-based wikis are instantly recognizable because they have many links with names such as "TableOfContents" and "BeginnerQuestions." It is possible for a wiki to render the visible anchor of such links "pretty" by reinserting spaces, and possibly also reverting to lower case. However, this reprocessing of the link to improve the readability of the anchor is limited by the loss of capitalization information caused by CamelCase reversal. For example, "RichardWagner" should be rendered as "Richard Wagner", whereas "PopularMusic" should be rendered as "popular music". There is no easy way to determine which [[capital letter]]s should remain capitalized. As a result, many wikis now have "free linking" using brackets, and some disable CamelCase by default.

===Searching===
Most wikis offer at least a title [[search algorithm|search]], and sometimes a [[Full text search|full-text search]]. The scalability of the search depends on whether the wiki engine uses a database. Some wikis, such as [[PmWiki]], use [[flat file]]s.<ref name=Augar>{{cite journal |title=Teaching and learning online with wikis |last1=Naomi |first1=Augar |first2=Ruth |last2=Raitman |first3=Wanlei |last3=Zhou |publisher=Proceedings of Beyond the Comfort Zone: 21st ASCILITE Conference |citeseerx=10.1.1.133.1456|year=2004}}</ref> MediaWiki's first versions used flat files, but it was rewritten by [[Lee Daniel Crocker]] in the early 2000s (decade) to be a database application. Indexed database access is necessary for high speed searches on large wikis. Alternatively, external [[Web search engine|search engines]] such as [[Google Search]] can sometimes be used on wikis with limited searching functions in order to obtain more precise results.

==History==
{{Main|History of wikis}}
[[File:HNL Wiki Wiki Bus.jpg|thumb|[[Wiki Wiki Shuttle]] at [[Honolulu International Airport]]]]
[[WikiWikiWeb]] was the first wiki.<ref name="ebersbach10">{{harvnb|Ebersbach|2008|p=10}}</ref> Ward Cunningham started developing WikiWikiWeb in Portland, Oregon, in 1994, and installed it on the [[Domain name|Internet domain]] [[c2.com]] on March 25, 1995. It was named by Cunningham, who remembered a [[Honolulu International Airport]] counter employee telling him to take the "[[Wiki Wiki Shuttle]]" bus that runs between the airport's terminals. According to Cunningham, "I chose wiki-wiki as an alliterative substitute for 'quick' and thereby avoided naming this stuff quick-web."<ref name="cunningham">{{cite web | last = Cunningham | first = Ward | url = http://c2.com/doc/etymology.html | title = Correspondence on the Etymology of Wiki | date = November 1, 2003 | publisher = WikiWikiWeb | accessdate = March 9, 2007 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070317120823/http://c2.com/doc/etymology.html | archivedate = March 17, 2007 | df = mdy-all }}</ref><ref name="history">{{cite web |last=Cunningham |first=Ward |url=http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiHistory |title=Wiki History |publisher=WikiWikiWeb |date=February 25, 2008 |accessdate=March 9, 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020621221535/http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiHistory |archivedate=June 21, 2002 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Cunningham was, in part, inspired by [[Apple Inc.]]'s [[HyperCard]], which he had used.

[[Wikipedia]] became the most famous wiki site, entering the top ten most popular websites in 2007. In the early 2000s (decade), wikis were increasingly adopted in enterprise as collaborative software. Common uses included project communication, intranets, and documentation, initially for technical users. Some [[corporate wiki|companies use wikis]] as their only collaborative software and as a replacement for static intranets, and some schools and universities use wikis to enhance [[group learning]]. There may be greater use of wikis behind [[Firewall (computing)|firewalls]] than on the public Internet. On March 15, 2007, the word ''wiki'' was listed in the online ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.<ref name="OED1">{{cite web | url = http://www.oed.com/public/update0703/march-2007-update | title = March 2007 update | publisher = [[Oxford English Dictionary]] | date = March 1, 2007 | last = Diamond | first = Graeme | accessdate = March 16, 2007 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110107132110/http://www.oed.com/public/update0703/march-2007-update | archivedate = January 7, 2011 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>

==Alternative definitions==
In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the word "wiki" was used to refer to both user-editable websites and the software that powers them; the latter definition is still occasionally in use.<ref name="Easy Wiki Hosting">{{citation |url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc700339.aspx |title=Easy Wiki Hosting, Scott Hanselman's blog, and Snagging Screens |date=July 2008 |last=Mitchell |first=Scott |publisher=MSDN Magazine |accessdate=March 9, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316192702/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc700339.aspx |archivedate=March 16, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Wiki inventor Ward Cunningham wrote in 2014<ref>[https://twitter.com/wardcunningham/status/531149812976996352 The plural of wiki is wiki.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101210215/https://twitter.com/wardcunningham/status/531149812976996352 |date=January 1, 2016 }}, Ward Cunningham, Twitter, November 8, 2014</ref> that the word "wiki" should not be used to refer to a single website, but rather to a mass of user-editable pages and or sites, so that a single website is not "a wiki" but "an instance of wiki". He wrote that the concept of wiki federation, in which the same content can be hosted and edited in more than one location in a manner similar to [[distributed version control]], meant that the concept of a single discrete "wiki" no longer made sense.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forage.ward.fed.wiki.org/view/an-install-of-wiki|title=Smallest Federated Wiki|work=wiki.org|accessdate=September 28, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928165957/http://forage.ward.fed.wiki.org/view/an-install-of-wiki|archivedate=September 28, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

==Implementations==
{{see also|List of wiki software}}
[[Wiki software]] is a type of [[collaborative software]] that runs a wiki system, allowing web pages to be created and edited using a common web browser. It may be implemented as a series of scripts behind an existing [[web server]], or as a standalone [[application server]] that runs on one or more web servers. The content is stored in a [[file system]], and changes to the content are stored in a [[relational database management system]]. A commonly implemented software package is [[MediaWiki]], which runs [[Wikipedia]]. Alternatively, [[personal wiki]]s run as a standalone application on a single computer. [[WikidPad]] is an example. One application, [[TiddlyWiki]], simply makes use of an even single local HTML file with JavaScript inside.

Wikis can also be created on a "[[wiki farm]]", where the server-side software is implemented by the wiki farm owner. [[PBwiki]], [[Socialtext]], and [[Wikia]] are popular examples of such services. Some wiki farms can also make private, password-protected wikis. Note that free wiki farms generally contain advertising on every page. For more information, see [[Comparison of wiki farms]].

==Trust and security==

===Controlling changes===
{{Selfref|"Recent changes" redirects here. For the Wikipedia help page, see [[Help:Recent changes]]. For the recent changes page itself, see [[Special:RecentChanges]]}}
[[File:History Comparison Example (Vector).png|thumb|History comparison reports highlight the changes between two revisions of a page.]]
Wikis are generally designed with the philosophy of making it easy to correct mistakes, rather than making it difficult to make them. Thus, while wikis are very open, they provide a means to verify the validity of recent additions to the body of pages. The most prominent, on almost every wiki, is the "Recent Changes" page—a specific list numbering recent edits, or a list of edits made within a given time frame.<ref>{{harvnb|Ebersbach|2008|p=20}}</ref> Some wikis can filter the list to remove minor edits and edits made by automatic importing scripts ("[[Internet bot|bots]]").<ref>{{harvnb|Ebersbach|2008|p=54}}</ref> From the change log, other functions are accessible in most wikis: the [[Changelog|revision history]] shows previous page versions and the [[diff]] feature highlights the changes between two revisions. Using the revision history, an editor can view and restore a previous version of the article. The diff feature can be used to decide whether or not this is necessary. A regular wiki user can view the diff of an edit listed on the "Recent Changes" page and, if it is an unacceptable edit, consult the history, restoring a previous revision; this process is more or less streamlined, depending on the wiki software used.<ref>{{harvnb|Ebersbach|2008|p=178}}</ref>

In case unacceptable edits are missed on the "recent changes" page, some wiki engines provide additional content control. It can be monitored to ensure that a page, or a set of pages, keeps its quality. A person willing to maintain pages will be warned of modifications to the pages, allowing him or her to verify the validity of new editions quickly.<ref>{{harvnb|Ebersbach|2008|p=109}}</ref> A watchlist is a common implementation of this. Some wikis also implement "patrolled revisions", in which editors with the requisite credentials can mark some edits as not vandalism. A "flagged revisions" system can prevent edits from going live until they have been reviewed.<ref>{{citation|title=Wikipedia's Labor Squeeze and its Consequences|journal=Journal on Telecommunications and High Technology Law|last = Goldman | first = Eric|volume=8}}</ref>

===Trustworthiness and reliability of content===
Critics of publicly editable wiki systems argue that these systems could be easily tampered with by malicious individuals ("vandals") or even by well-meaning but unskilled users who introduce errors into the content.

===Security===
{{selfref|"Edit war" redirects here. For Wikipedia's policy on edit warring, see [[Wikipedia:Edit warring]].}}
The open philosophy of wiki&nbsp;– allowing anyone to edit content – does not ensure that every editor's intentions are well-mannered. For example, [[cybervandalism|vandalism]] (changing wiki content to something offensive, adding nonsense, or deliberately adding incorrect information, such as [[hoax]] information) can be a major problem. On larger wiki sites, such as those run by the [[Wikimedia Foundation]], [[vandalism]] ''can ''go unnoticed for some period of time. Wikis, because of their open nature, are susceptible to intentional disruption, known as "[[troll (Internet)|trolling]]".
Wikis tend to take a ''[[soft security|soft-security]]''<ref name="soft security">{{citation|url=http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?SoftSecurity|title=Soft Security|accessdate=March 9, 2007|publisher=[[UseModWiki]]|date=September 20, 2006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204012847/http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?SoftSecurity|archivedate=February 4, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=July 2013|failed=y}} approach to the problem of vandalism, making damage easy to undo rather than attempting to prevent damage. Larger wikis often employ sophisticated methods, such as bots that automatically identify and revert vandalism and JavaScript enhancements that show characters that have been added in each edit. In this way, vandalism can be limited to just "minor vandalism" or "sneaky vandalism", where the characters added/eliminated are so few that bots do not identify them and users do not pay much attention to them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://m3m.homelinux.org/wikiMC/index.php/Security |title=Security |publisher=Assothink |accessdate=February 16, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106040941/http://m3m.homelinux.org/wikiMC/index.php/Security |archivedate=January 6, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=July 2013|failed=y}} An example of a bot that reverts vandalism on Wikipedia is ClueBot NG. ClueBot NG can revert edits, often within minutes, if not seconds. The bot uses [[machine learning]] in lieu of [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristics]].<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/18/5412636/this-machine-kills-trolls-how-wikipedia-robots-snuff-out-vandalism|title = This machine kills trolls|date = February 18, 2014|accessdate = September 7, 2014|publisher = The Verge|last = Hicks|first = Jesse|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140827115824/http://www.theverge.com/2014/2/18/5412636/this-machine-kills-trolls-how-wikipedia-robots-snuff-out-vandalism|archivedate = August 27, 2014|df = mdy-all}}</ref>

The amount of vandalism a wiki receives depends on how open the wiki is. For instance, some wikis allow unregistered users, identified by their [[IP address]]es, to edit content, while others limit this function to just registered users. Most wikis allow anonymous editing without an account,<ref>{{harvnb|Ebersbach|2008|p=108}}</ref> but give registered users additional editing functions; on most wikis, becoming a registered user is a short and simple process. Some wikis require an additional waiting period before gaining access to certain tools. For example, on the [[English Wikipedia]], registered users can rename pages only if their account is at least four days old and has made at least ten edits. Other wikis such as the [[Portuguese Wikipedia]] use an editing requirement instead of a time requirement, granting extra tools after the user has made a certain number of edits to prove their trustworthiness and usefulness as an editor. [[Vandalism of Wikipedia]] is common (though policed and usually reverted) because it is extremely open, allowing anyone with a computer and Internet access to edit it, although this makes it grow rapidly. In contrast, [[Citizendium]] requires an editor's real name and short autobiography, affecting the growth of the wiki but sometimes helping stop vandalism.

Edit wars can also occur as users repetitively revert a page to the version they favor. In some cases, editors with opposing views of which content should appear or what formatting style should be used will change and re-change each other's edits. This results in the page being "unstable" from a general users' perspective, because each time a general user comes to the page, it may look different. Some wiki software allows an administrator to stop such edit wars by locking a page from further editing until a decision has been made on what version of the page would be most appropriate.<ref name=Legal/> Some wikis are in a better position than others to control behavior due to governance structures existing outside the wiki. For instance, a college teacher can create incentives for students to behave themselves on a class wiki they administer by limiting editing to logged-in users and pointing out that all contributions can be traced back to the contributors. Bad behavior can then be dealt with in accordance with university policies.<ref name=Augar/> The issue of wiki vandalism is debated. In some cases, when an editor deletes an entire article and replaces it with nonsense content, it may be a "test edit", made by the user as she or he is experimenting with the wiki system. Some editors may not realize that they have damaged the page, or if they do realize it, they may not know how to undo the mistake or restore the content.

====Potential malware vector====
[[Malware]] can also be a problem for wikis, as users can add links to sites hosting malicious code. For example, a German Wikipedia article about the [[Blaster Worm]] was edited to include a hyperlink to a malicious website. Users of vulnerable Microsoft Windows systems who followed the link would be infected.<ref name=Legal/> A countermeasure is the use of software that prevents users from saving an edit that contains a link to a site listed on a [[blacklist]] of malware sites.<ref>[[meta:Spam blacklist/About|Meta.wikimedia.org]]</ref>

A city wiki contains information about specific instances of things, ideas, people and places. Much of this information might not be appropriate for [[encyclopedia]]s such as [[Wikipedia]] (e.g., articles on every retail outlet in a town), but might be appropriate for a wiki with more localized content and viewers. A city wiki could also contain information about the following subjects, that may or may not be appropriate for a general knowledge wiki, such as:
* Details of public establishments such as public houses, bars, accommodation or social centers
* Owner name, opening hours and statistics for a specific shop
* Statistical information about a specific road in a city
* Flavors of ice cream served at a local ice cream parlor
* A biography of a local mayor and other persons

{{distinguish|WikiNodes (Apple)}}
WikiNodes are pages on wikis that describe related wikis. They are usually organized as neighbors and delegates. A ''neighbor'' wiki is simply a wiki that may discuss similar content or may otherwise be of interest. A ''delegate'' wiki is a wiki that agrees to have certain content delegated to that wiki.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=WikiNodes |title=Frequently Asked Questions |url=http://wikinodes.wiki.taoriver.net/moin.fcg/FrequentlyAskedQuestions |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810213702/http://wikinodes.wiki.taoriver.net/moin.fcg/FrequentlyAskedQuestions |archivedate=August 10, 2007}}</ref> One way of finding a wiki on a specific subject is to follow the wiki-node network from wiki to wiki; another is to take a Wiki "bus tour", for example: {{srlink|Wikipedia:TourBusStop|Wikipedia's Tour Bus Stop}}.

===Participants===
The four basic types of users who participate in wikis are reader, author, wiki administrator and system administrator. The system administrator is responsible for installation and maintenance of the wiki engine and the container web server. The wiki administrator maintains wiki content and is provided additional functions pertaining to pages (e.g. page protection and deletion), and can adjust users' access rights by, for instance, blocking them from editing.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Analysis of the use of Wiki-based collaborations in enhancing student learning|last=Cubric|first=Marija|publisher=University of Hertfordshire|year=2007|url=https://uhra.herts.ac.uk/dspace/handle/2299/3672|accessdate=April 25, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515005430/https://uhra.herts.ac.uk/dspace/handle/2299/3672|archivedate=May 15, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

==Rules==
Wikis typically have a set of rules governing user behavior. Wikipedia, for instance, has a labyrinthine set of policies and guidelines summed up in its five pillars: Wikipedia is an encyclopedia; Wikipedia has a neutral point of view; Wikipedia is free content; Wikipedians should interact in a respectful and civil manner; and Wikipedia does not have firm rules. Many wikis have adopted a set of commandments. For instance, [[Conservapedia]] commands, among other things, that its editors use "[[Before Christ|B.C.]]" rather than "[[B.C.E.]]" when referring to years prior to [[Common Era|C.E.]] 1 and refrain from "unproductive activity."<ref>{{vcite web |url=http://www.conservapedia.com/Conservapedia:Commandments |work=Conservapedia.com |title=Conservapedia Commandments |date=May 15, 2010 |accessdate=July 24, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101022014810/http://conservapedia.com/Conservapedia:Commandments |archivedate=October 22, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> One teacher instituted a commandment for a class wiki, "[[The Golden Rule|Wiki unto others as you would have them wiki unto you]]."<ref name=Augar/>

==Legal environment==
Joint authorship of articles, in which different users participate in correcting, editing, and compiling the finished product, can also cause editors to become [[tenants in common]] of the copyright, making it impossible to republish without permission of all co-owners, some of whose identities may be unknown due to pseudonymous or anonymous editing.<ref name=Legal/> However, where persons contribute to a [[collective work]] such as an encyclopedia, there is no joint ownership if the contributions are separate and distinguishable.<ref>{{citation |work=Redwood Music Ltd v. B Feldman & Co Ltd|year=1979|publisher=RPC 385}}</ref> Despite most wikis' tracking of individual contributions, the action of contributing to a wiki page is still arguably one of jointly correcting, editing, or compiling, which would give rise to joint ownership. Some copyright issues can be alleviated through the use of an [[open content]] license. Version 2 of the [[GNU Free Documentation License]] includes a specific provision for wiki relicensing; [[Creative Commons]] licenses are also popular. When no license is specified, an implied license to read and add content to a wiki may be deemed to exist on the grounds of business necessity and the inherent nature of a wiki, although the legal basis for such an implied license may not exist in all circumstances.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Wikis and their users can be held liable for certain activities that occur on the wiki. If a wiki owner displays indifference and forgoes controls (such as banning copyright infringers) that he could have exercised to stop copyright infringement, he may be deemed to have authorized infringement, especially if the wiki is primarily used to infringe copyrights or obtains direct financial benefit, such as advertising revenue, from infringing activities.<ref name=Legal/> In the United States, wikis may benefit from [[Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act]], which protects sites that engage in "[[Good Samaritan]]" policing of harmful material, with no requirement on the quality or quantity of such self-policing.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Self-Regulation: How Wikipedia Leverages User-Generated Quality Control Under Section 230 | first1 = Kathleen M. | last1 = Walsh | first2 = Sarah | last2 = Oh | date = February 23, 2010 | url = http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&context=sarah_oh | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140106040705/http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&context=sarah_oh | archivedate = January 6, 2014 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> However, it has also been argued that a wiki's enforcement of certain rules, such as anti-bias, verifiability, reliable sourcing, and no-original-research policies, could pose legal risks.<ref>{{Citation|last = Myers | first = Ken S.|title=Wikimmunity: Fitting the Communications Decency Act to Wikipedia |journal=Harvard Journal of Law and Technology|publisher=The Berkman Center for Internet and Society|year=2008|ssrn=916529|volume=20|page=163}}</ref> When [[defamation]] occurs on a wiki, theoretically all users of the wiki can be held liable, because any of them had the ability to remove or amend the defamatory material from the "publication." It remains to be seen whether wikis will be regarded as more akin to an [[internet service provider]], which is generally not held liable due to its lack of control over publications' contents, than a publisher.<ref name=Legal/> It has been recommended that trademark owners monitor what information is presented about their trademarks on wikis, since courts may use such content as evidence pertaining to public perceptions. Joshua Jarvis notes, "Once misinformation is identified, the trade mark owner can simply edit the entry."<ref>{{citation|work=Managing Intellectual Property|last=Jarvis|first=Joshua|title=Police your marks in a wiki world|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&handle=hein.journals/manintpr179&div=31&id=&page=|pages=101–103|date=May 2008|issue=179|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304044437/http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&handle=hein.journals%2Fmanintpr179&div=31&id=&page=|archivedate=March 4, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref>
